<pre><code>        ##About
</code></pre>

<p>Kembrya has been an advocate for human rights since she was able to observe 
and understand. Born October 5th, 1998 she is a hardcore libra enthusiast!
She can often be found researching (fake) zodiacs (on Tumblr), watching Netflix, reading a book, 
touching up on social issues, chilling, or spending time with the ones she 
love most. She has a small circle of friends and a large crowd of associates, but
she loves everyone she's come in contact with because everything happens for a 
reason.   </p>

<p>Interest involve marching band, pep band, and concert band. 
Theater tech, book club, impact club, SAAD, and Girls Who Code (GWC) has taken up 
a lot of time out of her life this past year. She also volunteers for show
choir crew to help keep the fine arts program running efficiently.</p>
