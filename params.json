Born October 5th, 1998 she is a hardcore libra enthusiast!\r\nShe can often be found researching (fake) zodiacs (on Tumblr), watching Netflix, reading a book, \r\ntouching up on social issues, chilling, or spending time with the ones she \r\nlove most. She has a small circle of friends and a large crowd of associates, but\r\nshe loves everyone she's come in contact with because everything happens for a \r\nreason.   \r\n\t\t\r\nInterest involve marching band, pep band, and concert band. \r\nTheater tech, book club, impact club, SAAD, and Girls Who Code (GWC) has taken up \r\na lot of time out of her life this past year.
